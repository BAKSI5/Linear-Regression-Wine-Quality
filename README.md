# Linear-Regression-Wine-Quality

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for alcohol levels in wine using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression. Our goal is to create the most accurate model possible.

We will analyze the data using two approaches: one that considers only one explanatory variable at a time, and another that considers multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Throughout the project, we will work together to refine the model and improve its performance.

To accomplish our objective, we will be using the red wine dataset wineQualityReds.csv which is available on Kaggle.
